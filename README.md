Project Structure
The project consists of two parts: dashboard design and building an ML model. You can participate in the challenge with either part or submit both.

There are two main ways to undertake the project:

Unguided:
You only need to read the brief description of each task and analyze the metrics you find most relevant for depicting students’ engagement.
Guided:
You can use optional descriptions with detailed instructions regarding each task. Please note that this option offers ideas, not solutions. There is no right or wrong way to complete the challenge.
